================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: The code presents an instance of insecure communication as it fails to encrypt the password during authentication. This can lead to leakage of sensitive data during transmission.
Solution: Incorporate encryption or hashing during authentication and use secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS for transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: Although the possibility cannot be ascertained from this snippet alone, the program may contain hard-coded credentials, making the system trivial to attack if the code is ever exposed.
Solution: Store passwords and other sensitive information in properly protected configuration files or use environment variables. Never hard-code any secrets in your code.

Vulnerability: CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
Issue: The code does not illustrate how the user credentials are stored. If stored incorrectly, this could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Store passwords using tested and properly configured cryptographic methods, like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
Issue: This code provides no way to lock a user account after a certain number of failed login attempts, which could result in accounts being compromised via brute force attacks.
Solution: Implement an account lockout mechanism after a specific number of consecutive failed login attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The session token is not regenerated after successful login, which can lead to session fixation attacks.
Solution: Regenerate session after successful login.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful login with correct username and password

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulLoginWithCorrectCredentials.
  Description: This test verifies that login is successful with correct username and password.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock UserDetailsService to return a user details object when loadUserByUsername is called. Mock AuthenticationManager to authenticate the generated token.
  Act: Call the login method with a valid username and password.
  Assert: Check the return value is true.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method works properly with valid credentials. Importance of this test is to ensure that a genuine user can have access to their account.

Scenario 2: Failed login with invalid username

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithIncorrectUsername.
  Description: This test verifies that login fails if an incorrect username is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock UserDetailsService to throw an exception when loadUserByUsername is called.
  Act: Call the login method with an invalid username and valid password.
  Assert: Check the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles a case when an invalid username is provided. This test is important for ensuring security - unwanted users should be prevented from accessing other's accounts.

Scenario 3: Failed login with invalid password

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithIncorrectPassword.
  Description: This test verifies that login fails if an incorrect password is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock UserDetailsService to return a user details object when loadUserByUsername is called. Mock AuthenticationManager to throw an exception when authenticate is called.
  Act: Call the login method with a valid username and invalid password.
  Assert: Check the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles a case when the password for the user is wrong. This test is important for verifying that the application handles password checks correctly, ultimately ensuring security.

Scenario 4: Failed login with empty username and password

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithEmptyCredentials.
  Description: This test verifies that login fails if both username and password are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock UserDetailsService to throw an exception when loadUserByUsername is called.
  Act: Call the login method with an empty username and password.
  Assert: Check the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method does not authenticate users with empty credentials. This is crucial for ensuring that unauthorized users cannot bypass the login functionality by providing empty credentials.
